Basics of reproducible research
================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Motivation
-   Which is the [problem?](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&type=printable)
-   How [big is it?](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)
-   What is [reproducible research?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016WR019285/abstract)
-   What if research is [not reproducible?](https://retractionwatch.com/2013/02/01/seizure-study-retracted-after-authors-realize-data-got-terribly-mixed/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Main components of reproducible research

- Data: Easily accessible in [open data repository](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories) 
or provide the data from [your own server](https://shiny.fzp.czu.cz/KVHEM/OWDA/).

- Methods: Use [efficient workflow](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/preface.html), [robust directory layout](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/), [clean code](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), and share it with a version control, collaborative platform, such as [github](https://github.com/KVHEM/drought_uncertainty).

- Results: Share results in a dynamic way with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) or [Sharelatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/)/[Googledocs](https://www.google.ca/docs/about/).

To further enhance collaboration you can use [slack](https://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-use-slack-1.21228) or [Jupyter Notebooks](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/introduction-RR-Jupyter/docs/slides/Jupyter_Intro_Background.slides.html#/1).

### Pros and cons of the reproducible approach
_Pros_
- Dynamic
- Collaborative
- Archieving
- Increase audience  

_Cons_
- Time consuming
- Needs training/coordination

### Markdown

**What is Markdown?**

"Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers." *Source: [Markdown Web page](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)*

**Why Markdown has become so popular?**

Because...

1.  it is easy. To beign with all you need to learn is just the first [page](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).

2.  it is fast and clean; you make less mistakes -&gt; increases efficiency. Here is an [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

3.  it is portable; your documents can be edited in any text application on any operating system.

4.  it is flexible;
    -   many other platforms/languages are using it, e.g. Dropbox, Github and of course R.
    -   variety in applications (e.g. emails, webpages, presentations, even books!)

**So, why R Markdown?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### R Markdown

R Markdown has some significant strengths:

-   Supports many formats (HTML, PDF, Word), which..

-   Helps us present/teach a specific method in R, which..

-   Allows collaborative science and coding (cloud-computing), and also..
