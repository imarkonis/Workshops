This two-day workshop focuses on the integration of stochastic and deterministic 
methods for understanding and modelling the Earth system. The workshop will provide 
hands-on training in R programming language on cross-scale analyses of Earth system 
data, including, but not limited to hydrometeorological (e.g., temperature and 
precipitation) and ecosystem processes (tree growth and terrestrial carbon dynamics). 
By analyzing how the variability in Earth system observations changes across scales 
the underlying processes can be revealed, shedding light into dominant mechanisms 
and critical spatiotemporal scales. 

The first day of the workshop focuses onstarts with the theoretical foundations 
of cross-scale data analyses, including selected examples from published literature.
Then, Traditional traditional techniques for the exploration of multi-scale 
fluctuations (e.g., wavelet analysis) as well as new model-data integration 
approaches (scalegram) will be presented, confronting across a continuum of 
spatiotemporal scales observed patterns with model simulation results. Hands on 
training with publicly available Earth system observations will be provided.
The second day is optional and is designed to guide the participants to apply 
the methods presented during the previous day on their data sets and to address 
science questions relevant to their research. Here we aim to an open-ended and 
conversational session, tailored to the specific needs of each researcher.
